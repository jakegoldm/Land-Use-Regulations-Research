# Land-Use-Regulations-Research
Project completed during my junior year of high school to complete the AP Capstone Diploma. 
This involved importing census and regional data into mathematical models to provide a basis of comparison for 
the impacts of land-use regulations among rural, suburban, and urban counties in Virginia.
